# One-Skul — MVP Phase 1 Documentation

**Project:** One-Skul  
**Founder:** Abu Junior Vandi  
**Status:** MVP Phase 1 Complete  

One-Skul is a district-based public school directory and SaaS platform designed to bring transparency and accessibility to the education system. Phase 1 focuses on the core foundation: district-based school listing, a public directory, and a Super Admin management system.

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Laravel 12 (PHP 8.5)
- **Database:** SQLite (Relational structure)
- **Frontend:** React + Inertia.js 2.0
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (Modern, professional SaaS aesthetic)
- **Authentication:** Laravel Breeze (Inertia/React version)
- **Tooling:** Vite (Frontend bundling), Composer (PHP dependency management)

---

## 🚀 How to Run

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- **PHP 8.2+** (Project uses 8.5 features)
- **Node.js 18+** & **npm**
- **Composer**

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone/Open the Project:**
   ```bash
   cd One_SKul
   ```

2. **Install PHP Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

3. **Install JavaScript Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Environment Setup:**
   The `.env` file should be pre-configured for SQLite. If not:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   php artisan key:generate
   ```
   Ensure `DB_CONNECTION=sqlite` is set in `.env`.

5. **Database Migration & Seeding:**
   This creates the tables and populates the sample districts, schools, and the Super Admin account.
   ```bash
   php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
   ```

### Running the Application
You need to run **two** terminals simultaneously:

**Terminal 1 (Backend):**
```bash
php artisan serve
```
*Accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`*

**Terminal 2 (Frontend):**
```bash
npm run dev
```

## 📖 How to Use

### 1. Public Directory (Guest)
- **Homepage:** Navigate to the root URL to see all registered districts and a preview of approved schools.
- **District Page:** Click on a district card to see all approved public/private schools in that specific area.
- **School Profile:** Click "View Profile" on any school to see detailed information (Founder, Type, Principal, etc.).
- **"Proceed" Button:** A placeholder for Phase 2 registration features.

### 2. Admin System (Internal)
- **Login:** Visit `/login`.
- **Credentials:** 
  - **Email:** `admin@oneskul.com`
  - **Password:** `password`
- **Dashboard:** Provides a bird's-eye view of the system (Total districts, total schools, and schools awaiting approval).
- **Districts:** Add new districts to the system.
- **Schools:** Add new schools or **Approve/Reject** pending applications.
  - *Note: Schools will NOT appear on the public website until they are approved by the Super Admin.*

## 🏗 Development Walkthrough

### 1. Database Architecture
The project follows a cascading relational structure to ensure data integrity:
- **Districts** (id, name)
- **Schools** (id, **district_id**, name, year_founded, school_type, principal_name, is_approved)
- **Users** (id, **school_id (nullable)**, name, email, role [super_admin|admin])

*Rule: Every school-related record requires a `school_id` for future multi-tenant SaaS expansion.*

### 2. Backend Logic
- **Controllers:** 
  - `PublicController`: Handles high-performance read operations for the directory.
  - `AdminController`: Handles CRUD operations for management.
- **Security:** Custom middleware `EnsureUserIsSuperAdmin.php` intercepts requests to `/admin/*` to ensure only authorized personnel can access sensitive data.
- **Relationships:** Used Laravel Eloquent `Eager Loading` (`with('schools')`) to minimize database queries and ensure fast page loads.

### 3. Frontend Architecture
- **Inertia.js:** Used as the "bridge" between Laravel and React, allowing for a Single Page Application (SPA) experience without the complexity of a client-side API.
- **Shared Props:** Application state (like flash messages and auth user) is shared globally via `HandleInertiaRequests.php`.
- **Reusable Components:** Leveraged Breeze's pre-built components (Buttons, Modals, Inputs) for consistency and speed.

### 4. Aesthetics & UX
- **Theme:** Clean, neutral palette with "One-Skul Blue" (`blue-600`) as the primary action color.
- **UX:** Implemented breadcrumb navigation on all public pages for easy directory traversal.
- **Transitions:** Smooth Inerita-based page transitions for a premium feel.
